# Thruster-Development

This code is designed to calculate the thruster design parameters
for a liquid bi-propellant engine from initial design input, including:
- Design Chamber Pressure
- Design Thrust Level
- Propellant Density, Molar Mass, Thermodynamic Transport Properties

This provides an output of the nozzle and chamber contour for an engine that can be subsequently be transferred over to SolidWorks, Onshape or any other CAD software to create the initial wireframe

Future developments to include a greater range of injector geometries,
conjugate heat transfer analysis and a wider range of materials, including AlSi10Mg and GrCop-42
