# Thruster-Development

This code is designed to calculate the thruster design parameters
for a liquid bi-propellant engine from initial design inputs including:
- Design Chamber Pressure
- Design Thrust Level
- Propellant Density, Molar Mass, Thermodynamic Transport Properties

Future developments to include a greater range of injector geometries,
conjugate heat transfer analysis and a wider range of materials including AlSi10Mg and GrCop-42
