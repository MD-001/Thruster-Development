# Thruster-Development

This code is designed to calculate the thruster design parameters
for a liquid bi-propellant engine from initial design input, including:
- Design Chamber Pressure
- Design Thrust Level
- Propellant Density, Molar Mass, Thermodynamic Transport Properties

This provides an output of the nozzle and chamber contour for an engine, which can be transferred to SolidWorks, Onshape, or any other CAD software to create the initial wireframe.

The code includes a methodology for sizing regenerative cooling channels based on the Gneliski Correlation for Carbon-based fuel and the McCarthy-Wolf for Hydrogen-Oxygen systems. 

Future developments to include a greater range of: 
- injector geometries including Simplex Swirl, Coaxial and Pintle 
- Incorporation of a conjugate heat transfer model
- A wider range of materials, including AlSi10Mg and GrCop-42
- Turbomachinery Modelling
